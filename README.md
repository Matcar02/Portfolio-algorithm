# Portfolio-algorithm
In this repository, you can find a very simple algorithm used to assess correlations among different stocks. This helps an investor to diversify the financial portfolio; Even though the algorithm isn't the most efficient (This was made by me and other 2 colleagues for an algorithms project which forced us not to use some built-in python modules or functions), it gives a rough idea of stocks market correlation and how one retail investor can use a simple python script to keep track of market movements. Below some relevant (hopefully) information about the implementation.

Final remark: In the implementation you will find "720" and "360". This refers to the initial price of the stock and to its final price since the dataset collects all daily stock prices in a 2 year range.
