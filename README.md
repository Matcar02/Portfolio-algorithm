# Portfolio-algorithm
In this repository, you can find a very simple algorithm used to assess correlations among different stocks. This helps an investor to diversify the financial portfolio; Even though the algorithm isn't the most efficient(This was made by me and other2 colleagues for an algorithms project which forced us not to use some built-in python modules or functions), it gives a rough idea of  stocks market correlation. Below some relevant(hopefully) information about the implementation.
